# JavaScript Operators, Methods, and Keywords

## Complete and debug code that uses assignment and arithmetic operators

Assignment
: Sets a value to a variable
: ex: `x = 1`

Increment
: Adds one to a numerical variable
: ex: `x++`

Decrement
: Subracts one from a numerical variable
: ex: `x--`

Arithmetic Operators
: Used just like in math
: ex: `+` to add `-` to subtract `/` to divide `*` to multiply

Modulus
: Returns the remainder of a division problem
: ex `x % 10`

Compound Assignment Operators
: A quicker way of doing math and updating the variable
: ex: instead of `x = x * 2` we do `x *= 2`

## Apply JavaScript best practices

Comments
: single line `//`
: multiline `/*` to start `*/` to end

Indentation
: Always indent everything inside curly brackets

Yes:

```javascript
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
    return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
```

No:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```javascript
function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
return (5 / 9) * (fahrenheit - 32);
}
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

Naming Conventions
: Names can contain letters, digits underscores, and dollar signs.
: Names must begin with a letter. Names can also begin with $ and \_ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
: Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
: Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

noscript
: The noscript element in HTML allows us to warn user's that thier browser does not support JavaScript

```html
<noscript> Your browser does not support Javascript </noscript>
```

Constants
: Constants are variables that cannot be reassigned

```javascript
const x = 3;
x = 4; // This will cause an error
```

Reserved Keywords
: Variable, function, and array names cannot be the same as words already used by JavaScript
: There are many but some examples include: let, for, function, and var

Pausing the code
: The `debugger` keyword will pause the code on the line where it is written

```javascript
var x = 2;
debugger;
x = 5; // x will not be set to 5 because the code will pause on the line above
```

console.log();
: `console.log();` will print anything inside the parentheses to the browser's console (you'll have to press F12 to see the console)

```javascript
console.log('Hello, world!');
```

output: `Hello, world!`

## Evaluate the use of internal and external scripts

Internal Scripts
: Internal scripts are scripts written into the html code inside `<script>` tags

```html
<script>
    var x = 2;
</script>
```

External Scripts
: External scripts are scripts written in a file seperate from the html code in a file that ends in .js
: Script tags are not needed in external scripts
: The external script must be linked with an `src` attribute

```javascript
/* In a file named script.js */
var x = 2;
```

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

Scripts run top to bottom regardless of whether they are internal or external.

## Implement exception handling

try, catch, finally
: `try`, `catch`, `finally` are blocks that we can wrap our code in to catch potential errors.
: `try` holds the code that might contain an error
: `catch` holds code that will run if an error occurs
: `finally`

```javascript
try {
    aplert('test message');
} catch (err) {
    console.log(err.message);
} finally {
    console.log('Program over');
}
```

Output:

```bash
aplert is not defined
Program over
```

## Browser Object Model

Dialogs
: `alert();` Shows a message
: `confirm();` Shows a message and recieves a yes or no from the user
: `prompt();` Shows a message and recieves text from the user

Screen Size
: `screen.width` returns the width of the user's monitor display
: `screen.height` returns the height of the user's monitor display
